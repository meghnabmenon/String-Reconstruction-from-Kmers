# String-Reconstruction-from-Kmers
This is a basic genome assembly activity implemented on Scala. A genome is taken split into different k-mers. Usually, the term k-mer refers to all of a sequence's subsequences of length.
Counting k-mers (substrings of length k in DNA sequence data) is an essential component of many methods in bioinformatics, including for transcription and error correction of sequence reads.
After the splitting is done , k-mers are arranged in a lexicographical order and finally reconstructed using concatenation of the k-mers
